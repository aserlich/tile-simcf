This repository contains the source code for two R packages:

tile  :: A complete graphical system, build on grid, with strengths 
         in tiled displays of multiple plots and in visualizing
         the relationships estimated by regression models, and
         uncertainty in those estimated relationships.

simcf :: A complementary package with a convenient scenario-builder
         for constructing counterfactuals for models defined by
         R formulas, and a collection of simple tools for simulating
         quantities of interest, including conditional expected values,
         conditional differences, relative risks, and predicted values,
         for a variety of regression models.

Individuals interested in contributing to either or both packages
should contact Chris Adolph (cadolph@uw.edu).
